# Changes and Feature List

## Version 1.3.0 Reliable Serial Communication
* **Serial communication is able to automatically reconnect** in case of temporary connection/serial port loss.
* Serial communication performance improved

## Version 1.2.4 GUI for Automatic Generation of Configuration
* Device and sensor discovery and automatic generation of configuration improved and GUI added (See [docs](./eltakodevice_discovery/readme.md))
* &#x1F41E; Fixed Bug &#x1F41E;: Device names fixed.
* Improved config flow
* Support for serial over ethernet added

## Version 1.2.3 Improvements in Device Discovery
* &#x1F41E; Fixed Bug &#x1F41E;: Entity grouping for devices were broken.
* Eltako FMZ14 is working and tested ([Multifunction Time Relay](https://www.eltako.com/fileadmin/downloads/en/_bedienung/FMZ14_30014009-2_gb.pdf))
* Adjusted and extended [device discovery](./eltakodevice_discovery/readme.md) to multi-gateway support
* Windows support for device discovery added
* Device discovery detects base id of FAM14 automatically
* Device discovery detects a few registered sensors and puts them into the auto generated configuration.

## Version 1.2.2 Support for Multiple Gateways
* Full support for gateway [Eltako FAM-USB](https://www.eltako.com/en/product/professional-standard-en/three-phase-energy-meters-and-one-phase-energy-meters/fam-usb/)
* Target temperature synchronization between climate panel in Home Assistant and thermostat implemented.
* BaseId validation for gateways introduced. It will show warnings as output logs.
* Device Id can be displayed in device name optionally.
* Home Assistant eventing prepared to support more than one gateway
* Introduced ids for gateways.
* Manual installation of multiple gateways/hubs implemented. 
* **&#x26A0; Breaking Changes &#x26A0;**
  * All devices get a new identifier. Unfortunately, all devices need to be deleted and recreated. History of data gets lost!!!
  * Configuration: 'id' in 'gateway' is mandatory. See [docs](./docs/update_home_assistant_configuration.md)
  * Events in Home Assistant for switch telegrams have got different event_ids. This affects automations reacting on old event ids. See [docs](./docs/rocker_switch/readme.md)

## Version 1.1.3
* Added read-only support for gateway [Eltako FAM-USB](https://www.eltako.com/en/product/professional-standard-en/three-phase-energy-meters-and-one-phase-energy-meters/fam-usb/)

## Version 1.1.2
* Docs for configuration added
* USB port for serial communication can be configured in gateway section.
* Configuration keys were made consistent. Replaced '-' through '_'. This change may require adaptation to existing configurations.

## version 1.1.1 - BugFix
* Problems with general-settings in configuration file.

## version 1.1.0 - Heating and Cooling
* Change file introduced
* **Climate Panel introduced** incl. support for actors like FAE14, FHK14, F4HK14, F2L14, FHK61, FME14 and EEP A5-10-06 as well as control panels like FTAF55ED.
* Docs for Climate Panel/Heating and Cooling
* Refactoring
  * Introduced many explicit types.
  * Logging improved
* Prepared config for other gateway types. (Currently supported Eltako fam14 and fgw14-usb)
* Support of different gateways e.g. enOcean USB300 with different protocol version (ESP3)
* Added teach-in buttons for climate and temperature controller
* Added Air Quality Sensor with EEP A5-09-0C for e.g. FLGTF
* Integrate Eltako FUTH ([Wireless thermo clock/hygrostat](https://www.eltako.com/fileadmin/downloads/en/_bedienung/FUTH65D_12-24VUC_30065741-1_gb.pdf))
  * Temperature synchronization with FUTH and Home Assistant Climate (temperature controller) not yet properly working.
* Fast status change added. You can set per configuration is you want to wait for actuator response or if you directly want to see the status change in HA.

## Version 1.0.0 Baseline

## Backlog
* Docs for Configuration Schema
* Extend device discovery for heating and cooling actuators
* Gateway availability checks for send commands.
* Reconnect for serial interface.
